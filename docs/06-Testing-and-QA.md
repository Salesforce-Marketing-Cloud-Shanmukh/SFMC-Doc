Testing & Quality Assurance
===========================

Reusable Test Cases
-------------------
- Data readiness for all entry sources and DE lookups.
- Personalization resolution (AMPscript/SSJS), fallback paths, null handling.
- Link tracking, UTMs, and CAN-SPAM footer compliance.
- Journey wait times, path splits, re-entry, and exit criteria.

QA Checklists
-------------
- Journey Builder: entry criteria, goal metrics, error events, throttling.
- Automation Studio: schedule windows, concurrency, fail notifications.
- Integrations: API rate limits, retries, response validation.

UAT & Optimization
------------------
- A/B test designs, sample sizes, significance thresholds.
- Seed list and inbox rendering tests across major clients.
