Environment & Business Unit Strategy
====================================

Environments
------------
- Development: experimentation, feature branches, mock integrations.
- Test/UAT: integrated validation, data masks, production-like assets.
- Production: restricted access, monitored automations, audited deployments.

Business Units (BU)
-------------------
- Structure by region/brand where data residency and consent vary.
- Shared assets via Shared Folders and Content Builder permissions.
- Define roles: Marketer, Analyst, Developer, Admin; apply least privilege.

Governance
----------
- Approval workflows for sends, journeys, and automations.
- Naming conventions and foldering standards for portability.
- Deployment via Package Manager where possible; document manual steps.
